## ABSTRACT
Humans make irrational decisions in the presence of irrelevant distractor options. There is little consensus on whether decision making is facilitated or impaired by the presence of a highly rewarding distractor, or whether the distractor effect operates at the level of options’ component attributes rather than at the level of their overall value. To reconcile different claims, we argue that it is important to consider the diversity of people’s styles of decision making and whether choice attributes are combined in an additive or multiplicative way. Employing a multi-laboratory dataset investigating the same experimental paradigm, we demonstrated that people used a mix of both approaches and the extent to which approach was used varied across individuals. Critically, we identified that this variability was correlated with the distractor effect during decision making. Individuals who tended to use a multiplicative approach to compute value, showed a positive distractor effect. In contrast, a negative distractor effect (divisive normalisation) was prominent in individuals tending towards an additive approach. Findings suggest that the distractor effect is related to how value is constructed, which in turn may be influenced by task and subject specificities. This concurs with recent behavioural and neuroscience findings that multiple distractor effects co-exist.

## USAGE NOTES
- Analysis using the scripts attached were originally performed in MATLAB R2022a.
- To run any of the scripts, the user needs to perform the following actions:
1. Install the VBA toolbox (https://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/)
2. Download the open source scripts published by Cao & Tsetsos, 2022 (https://github.com/YinanCao/multiattribute-distractor) and place the folder (i.e., multiattribute-distractor-main) in the same folder as the scripts downloaded here
